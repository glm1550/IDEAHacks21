# IDEAHacks21
Am I Busy? Collaborative project with Grace Ma for IDEAHacks21 

This project was the result of 2 days during a remote Hackathon, with the help of various volunteers from UCLA.
It utilized hardware in the form of an ESP32, OLED Display, push button, and IR emitter pairing. 
HTML, Javascript, and CSS, created a website intended for a aesthetic UI and called upon the necessary API required to communicate with the database.
